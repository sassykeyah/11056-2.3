# Reflection
To start the basis of my responsive design system. I initially researched other systems and what the basics of responsive design was. I wasn’t initially inspired by a particular responsive design system, but I did focus on the different layouts other galleries and art/creative institutions used. An example of this was Studio Gallery Melbourne

I was really fixated on the display of images and content they had, and upon downsizing the images didn’t squash, and refocused. I liked their simplistic design and thought their use of grids was efficient.  

I understood that there were a few main concepts to create the basis of a responsive design, three in fact, that I would follow to create the basis of my system. It had to have media queries, to enable the chosen or created breakpoints within the system.  

So I started with that, originally designing my website to have three designated breakpoints for the three main device screens. Yet this set boundaries and limitations for me, and I felt like adding breakpoints into my design made it more complicated for me to code, and for potential consistent users using it over different devices. From this point, I had to research more to understand what a breakpoint was and how differently they can be used in responsive design. The research I found reflected my past thinking, that creating designated breakpoints would create a brittle structure, that although with my intention to make fluid, would be more clunky.  I read something stating that ‘there are over 8.48B unique devices in existence today’ (Jes Kirkwood, Invision App). Meaning that designing for particular device breakpoints just seems like a waste of time.  So to combat this, I decided to work with my site until it broke, which on the basic level it is now, it hadn’t. My site at this stage has no particular ‘breakpoints’, although the media queries showcase the different potential views, the content does not change to become unreadable. Although I have realised that a mobile breakpoint will probably be needed as I add more content and components to my site.  

The second theoretical component I focused on was image responsiveness. The website I am intending to create will be sleek and modern, and with that, will probably have design elements such as a lot of different images, blank space and big hero content. I started by creating a hero content back ground image for just under the header. This reflected the modern and sleek look I needed, with a huge image as the main focal point, yet the responsiveness wasn’t reflecting the fluidity of design I needed.  Whenever I when to resize to showcase a different screen type, the hero content would follow and resize as well. Through multiple attempts at positioning it using CSS, I ended up with support of Ben, able to source it to the other image in the html changing the style of the hero content. I hadn’t added a hero tag and therefore it was not differentiating between the two nor was it making the width 100%, like I wanted. My project reflects a system that doesn’t have a separated structure and I plan to continue to design it like this. At this stage there are no breakpoints, yet there is room for them to be instated if the site fails with further content addition.
